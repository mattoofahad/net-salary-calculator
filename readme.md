# Salary Calculator

This Salary Calculator is a Python-based command-line tool designed to help users determine the additional amount needed on top of their desired salary to account for taxes. It takes into consideration factors such as current salary, desired increment, daily travel costs, and the number of physical workdays per week.

## Getting Started

### A. Prerequisites

- Conda environment manager
- Python version 3.11

### B. Setting Up the Environment

1. **Create and activate a Conda environment**:
   - Create: `conda create -n salary_calc_env python=3.11 -y`
   - Activate: `conda activate salary_calc_env`
   - **Note**: You can replace `salary_calc_env` with your preferred environment name.

2. **Install required packages**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### C. Running the Application

- Using default values:
  ```bash
  python salary_calculator.py 90000
  ```
  This uses default values of `desired_increment_percentage=0.3`, `daily_cost_of_travel=1500`, and `physical_days_per_week=5`.

- Using custom values:
  ```bash
  python salary_calculator.py 220000 --desired-increment-percentage 0.10 --daily-cost-of-travel 2000 --physical-days-per-week 3
  ```
F

  ```
